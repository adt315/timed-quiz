## Timed Quiz

The goal of this project was to build a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions. 
JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML were used.

### How it works:
- When you click the start button a timer starts and you are presented with a multiple-choice question
- After you click on an answer choice button it will say if your answer is right or wrong
- If your guess is wrong, 10 seconds will be subtracted from your time
- Then you will be presented with another question
- When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the game is over
- When the game is over your score will be shown, which is equal to the time left on the clock
- You can save you initials and score to the list of High Scores
